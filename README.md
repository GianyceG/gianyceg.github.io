# Introduction

The use of historical data for the purpose trying to "predict the future" has been an idea that has been explored for ages, but what happens when we deal with sequential data, evolving over time. This is where time series analysis becomes essential. First recognized in the 1970s, particularly through the Box-Jenkins method and ARIMA models, time series analysis provides a powerful way to forecast future outcomes based on historical data. The rising need for data-driven solutions makes time series forecasting crucial for the future of industry and operations. This capstone will focus on applying ARIMA/SARIMA and Bayesian STS forecasting methodology to COVID-19 dataset and CO2 Emission dataset.
