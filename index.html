  <div id="Intro" class="tabcontent">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The use of time series analysis gained recognition since 1970 when the Box-Jenkins method popularized ARIMA models to find the best fit of different time series models based on past data. However, the concept of analyzing sequential data over time is not new. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven solutions to forecast future industry outcomes, time series analysis has become vital in numerous fields. This includes public health initiatives, such as those that arose in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and issues that could arise with the increase of CO2 emissions in Hawaii. Both highlight the importance of time series in addressing real-world issues.</p>
    <p>Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series. In the data, I will look at regular intervals of time. The data I analyze typically occur at regular intervals, allowing us to observe trends and seasonal patterns. Time series forecasting is a statistical method used to predict future values based on past results. The simplest models focus solely on the variable being forecast, ignoring external factors like marketing efforts or economic shifts, and instead extrapolating existing trends and seasonality. Specifically in this capstone, I will be exploring univariate models.</p>
    <p>Currently, efforts to perfect the science of forecasting is important as the higher the accuracy of a time series based on past data and events, the more essential the tool becomes for modern organizations as accurate forecasts support decision-making across various timeframesâ€”whether short-term, medium-term, or long-term, depending on the specific application. Key considerations in forecasting include seasonality, trends, and external fluctuations, which play a significant role in shaping predictions. These specifically will be explored more as I deal with the data sets of this project. These forecasts are integral for planning, resource allocation, and adjusting strategies in response to upcoming movements.</p>
    <p>In this capstone, I will explore the Johns Hopkins CSSEGISandData COVID-19 Repository, which tracks global COVID-19 cases and Our World in Data (OWID), which provides comprehensive COVID-19 datasets across various indicators datasets to test the univariate models ARIMA/SARIMA and Bayesian STS. Using the same model structures, I will also be exploring the Forecasting CO2 Emissions in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. This dataset is provided by the Global Monitoring Laboratory within NOAA. The goal of this exploration is to apply time series analysis to forecast the future spread of COVID-19, seeing which models are the strongest to do such a task, and to use those same models to appropriately forecast the increasing trend of the CO2 emission rates. These two different datasets and applications are to show the strength in forecasting in multiple real-life situations. This is important in data science and statistics, particularly in public health and global policy as creating accurate forecasts can allow policymakers a better direction on what should be applied and when. </p>
    <p>To achieve the goals of my capstone, ARIMA/SARIMA will be used for capturing linear trends and seasonal effects, and Bayesian STS for incorporating uncertainty and providing probabilistic forecasts. The project will begin with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the time series data, identify patterns, and check for seasonality or trends. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I will test both models using Python on the COVID-19 and CO2 datasets. The results will then be compared to assess which approach yields the most accurate and insightful forecasts. </p>

    <h2>Methods for COVID-19 </h2>
    <p>My project explores time series forecasting using two distinct datasets: one focused on COVID-19 data and the other on U.S. Census data. I will begin by explaining the methods I plan to apply to the COVID-19 dataset.</p>
    <p>This part of the project uses time series forecasting on the COVID-19 dataset from the Johns Hopkins CSSEGISandData Repository and Our World in Data (OWID), with an emphasis on modeling the data using ARIMA/SARIMA and Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS). AR and ARIMA models are univariate (single-variable) time series methods without trend or seasonal components, while other time series models, such as SARIMA, can capture multivariate series with trends and seasonal patterns. Specifically, I will focus on ARIMA since it is effective for univariate modeling, which aligns with the goals of this project.</p>
    <p> First, the data will be loaded into JupyterNotebook and processed with Python. Then, the data is already cleaned through the github repository CSSEGISandData.
    <p>ARIMA is well-suited for forecasting because it applies mathematical techniques to smooth non-stationary time series data, making it easier to predict future values by analyzing historical patterns. These models estimate and extrapolate future states based on trends observed in past and present data. The use of ARIMA for univariate forecasting in this context is ideal for capturing the patterns in the COVID-19 dataset.</p>
    

    <h3>ARIMA Model</h3>
    <p>The ARIMA model is defined by the parameters \( (p, d, q) \), where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( p\) is the number of lag observations (autoregressive terms).</li>
      <li>\( d\) is the number of times the data must be differenced to make it stationary.</li>
      <li>\( q\) is the number of lagged forecast errors (moving average terms).</li>
      
  <p>My ARIMA(5,0,5) Model:</p>
<p>For this specific COVID-19 data and the model that I will end up generating, the following is the mathematical expression of my ARIMA model in general terms:</p>
<p>
    \[Y_t = c + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_5 Y_{t-5} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \epsilon_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_5 \epsilon_{t-5} + \epsilon_t\]
</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( Y_t \): The value of the time series at time \( t \) (in this case, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Florida).</li>
    <li>\( c \): Constant term (intercept).</li>
    <li>\( \phi_i \) (\( i = 1, 2, \dots, 5 \)): Coefficients for the Auto-Regressive (AR) terms (from lag 1 to lag 5).</li>
    <li>\( Y_{t-i} \): The value of the time series at previous time steps (\( t-1, t-2, \dots, t-5 \)).</li>
    <li>\( \theta_i \) (\( i = 1, 2, \dots, 5 \)): Coefficients for the Moving Average (MA) terms (past errors).</li>
    <li>\( \epsilon_{t-i} \): Errors at previous time steps (\( t-1, t-2, \dots, t-5 \)).</li>
    <li>\( \epsilon_t \): Error term at time \( t \).</li>
</ul>

</ul><h3>ARIMA Model Application to Python</h3>

<p>The key libraries utilized for processing my ARIMA model were <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, and <strong>Statsmodels</strong>. I used <strong>Pandas</strong> extensively for data manipulation, including loading the dataset, converting date columns to datetime format, applying differencing to achieve stationarity, and other data preparation tasks. <strong>Matplotlib</strong> was instrumental in visualizing the time series, including plotting the original and differenced data, as well as visualizing the autocorrelation and forecast results. <strong>Statsmodels</strong> was used to fit the ARIMA model and provided essential tools for analyzing time series properties, such as plotting the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) and autocorrelation function (ACF), as well as fitting the model itself to make predictions.</p>
      
<h4>Process</h4>
<p>The process of applying my ARIMA model involved several key steps. It is especially important to note that the results were specified down to the Florida, USA level due to the mass size of the data.:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I processed the data from the Johns Hopkins dataset. They had the data already prepared and cleaned, organized by the country, province, state, update, confirmed cases, and more variables. These are the ones I focused on.</li>
  <li>I made sure that the date and time variables were all formatted correctly and cleaned up any NaN values.</li>
  <li>I graphed the general USA COVID-19 graph to see the structure in which the data was moving and determined it was not stationary because it had both a positive trend and it seemed to be affected by some sort of seasonality (this will be explored more in the SARIMA model).</li>
  <li>Applied first-order differencing to the time series data to make it stationary.</li>
  <li>Using the AIC function, I determined the most ideal ARIMA model parameters for (p,d,q).</li>
  <li>I fitted the model and checked the residuals for white noise.</li>
  <li>Developed a forecast for the next 30 days for the state of Florida.</li>
</ol>


  <h3>Bayesian Structural Time Series Model (BSTS)</h3>
    
<p>The BSTS model can be represented as follows:</p>
<p>
\[Y_t = T_t + S_t + X_t \beta + \epsilon_t\]
</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( Y_t \) is the observed value of the time series at time \( t \) (e.g., COVID-19 confirmed cases in Florida).</li>
  <li>\( T_t \) represents the trend component, which captures the overall movement of the COVID-19 cases over time.</li>
  <li>\( S_t \) is the seasonal component, used to model recurring weekly in my COVID-19 data.</li>
  <li>\( X_t \) represents the regressors, which include external variables such as public policies, mobility, or vaccination rates.</li>
  <li>\( \beta \) is the vector of regression coefficients for the regressors.</li>
  <li>\( \epsilon_t \) is the error term at time \( t \), accounting for random noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the COVID-19 data in Florida, the BSTS model captures the underlying trend, any seasonal effects (such as pandemic waves or reporting delays), and the effect of external factors like public health measures. Bayesian estimation allows for uncertainty quantification, and the components are estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the model.</p>

<h4>Process ( This is GENERAL right now, WILL make more specific as I code) </h4>
<ol>
  <li>Load the dataset and ensure all necessary variables are in the appropriate format for time series analysis (e.g., convert dates to datetime format, handle missing values).</li>
  <li>Define the components of the BSTS model, such as the trend, seasonal, and regression components. Each component captures a specific feature of the time series, like long-term patterns or periodicity.</li>
  <li>Use a Bayesian approach to estimate the model parameters based on the observed data. This involves setting priors and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the model.</li>
  <li>Assess model fit by evaluating posterior distributions of parameters, inspecting residuals, and computing prediction intervals to ensure the model is capturing the underlying patterns of the data.</li>
  <li>Use the fitted BSTS model to generate future forecasts. Predictive intervals are also computed, allowing for uncertainty quantification in the forecasts.</li>
  <li>Perform model diagnostics such as comparing predictions to actual values (cross-validation) or calculating prediction accuracy metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to validate the model's performance.</li>
  <li>Plot the time series, model components, and forecasted values to visually evaluate how well the model explains the data.</li>
</ol>
    
    <h2>Methods For Labor Forecasting</h2>
    <p>My project explores time series forecasting using two distinct datasets: one focused on COVID-19 data and the other on U.S. Bureau of Statistics data. In these methods, I will be focusing on the U.S. Census datasets and how I can apply the models that I have used for this data as well. You can find more details about the dataset <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    
    <p>This part of the project uses time series forecasting on the U.S. Bureau of Statistics datasets, with an emphasis on modeling the data using ARIMA/SARIMA and Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS). These models will attempt to forecast income disparities within the U.S. and, based on current income, project future earnings. I will specifically be attempting to project Q4 earnings for different work industries within Osceola County, Florida. AR and ARIMA models are univariate (single-variable) time series methods without trend or seasonal components. Specifically, I will focus on ARIMA since it is effective for univariate modeling, which aligns with the goals of this project.</p>
    
    <p>First, the data will be loaded into Jupyter Notebook and processed with Python. Then, the data needs to be prepared as it is not from a current repository, unlike the COVID-19 dataset.</p>
    
    <p>ARIMA is well-suited for forecasting because it applies mathematical techniques to smooth non-stationary time series data, making it easier to predict future values by analyzing historical patterns. These models estimate and extrapolate future states based on trends observed in past and present data. The use of ARIMA for univariate forecasting in this context is ideal for capturing the patterns in the U.S. Census dataset, as we are not dealing with seasonality and are trying to capture the movement of current data based on income levels to project what could be made in the future.</p> 
    
    <p>To accomplish this, I will utilize two forecasting approaches: ARIMA and Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS). Below are the steps involved in my methodology:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Download the quarterly earnings data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. I will be looking at 2020-2024, and using the past 3 years to build the model.</li>
        <li>Upload the datasets into Python.</li>
        <li>Visualize the data to understand its structure and behavior.</li>
        <li>Apply transformations to make the time series data stationary.</li>
        <li>Plot the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) and Autocorrelation Function (ACF) to determine the appropriate parameters.</li>
        <li>Analyze residuals to validate the accuracy of the model.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Similarly as before, we will be applying the Bayesian Model as well to this dataset and comparing the results that have been obtained.</p>
