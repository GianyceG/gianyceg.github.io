    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series. In the data, I will look at regular intervals of time. Time series forecasting is a statistical method used to predict future values based on past results. The simplest models focus solely on the variable being forecast, ignoring external factors like marketing efforts or economic shifts, and instead extrapolating existing trends and seasonality. Specifically in this capstone, I will be exploring univariate models ARIMA/SARIMA and the Bayesian STS.</p>
    <p>The use of time series analysis gained recognition since 1970 when the Box-Jenkins method popularized ARIMA models to find the best fit of different time series models based on past data. However, the concept of analyzing sequential data over time is not new. As the world increasingly embraces data-driven solutions to forecast future industry outcomes, time series analysis has become vital in numerous fields. </p>
<p>Currently, efforts to perfect the science of forecasting is important as the higher the accuracy of a time series based on past data and events, the more essential the tool becomes for modern organizations as accurate forecasts support decision-making across various timeframes—whether short-term, medium-term, or long-term, depending on the specific application. Key considerations in forecasting include seasonality, trends, and external fluctuations, which play a significant role in shaping predictions. These specifically will be explored more as I deal with the data sets of this project. These forecasts are integral for planning, resource allocation, and adjusting strategies in response to upcoming movements.</p>
  <p>The main goal of my paper is to explore and discuss the concept and use real life datasets in order to see how time series analysis can use its historical data and leverage practical and meaningful conclusions. In this paper, we will also be discussing any possible limitations that the different time series models have and what some suggestions are to improve our predictions and possibly overcome these limitations. <p>
    <p>In this capstone, I will explore the Johns Hopkins CSSEGISandData COVID-19 Repository, which tracks global COVID-19 cases and Our World in Data (OWID), which provides comprehensive COVID-19 datasets across various indicators datasets to test the univariate models ARIMA/SARIMA and Bayesian STS. Using the same model structures, I will also be exploring the Forecasting CO2 Emissions in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. This dataset is provided by the Global Monitoring Laboratory within NOAA. The goal of this exploration is to apply time series analysis to forecast the future spread of COVID-19, seeing which models are the strongest to do such a task, and to use those same models to appropriately forecast the increasing trend of the CO2 emission rates. These two different datasets and applications are to show the strength in forecasting in multiple real-life situations. This is important in data science and statistics, particularly in public health and global policy as creating accurate forecasts can allow policymakers a better direction on what should be applied and when. </p>
    <p>To achieve the goals of my capstone, ARIMA/SARIMA will be used for capturing linear trends and seasonal effects, and Bayesian STS for incorporating uncertainty and providing probabilistic forecasts. The project will begin with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize the time series data, identify patterns, and check for seasonality or trends. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I will test both models using Python on the COVID-19 and CO2 datasets. The results will then be compared to assess which approach yields the most accurate and insightful forecasts. </p>
<h2>Time Series Forecasting Models</h2>
  <p>In different papers and studies, it is easy to see that there are a multitude of models to explore and chose from, depending on what is being questioned or asked from by the researcher and data. Most of the models can be seen following into different categories. Traditional statistical modeling, which includes a moving average, exponential smoothing, and autoregressive (ARIMA). These are seen as linear functions taking past observations to make sound predictions. Second category of model type is nonlinear models.</p>
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p> This is going to discuss limitations of the models selected.</p>

    <h2>Methods for COVID-19 </h2>
    <p>My project explores time series forecasting using two distinct datasets: one focused on COVID-19 data and the other on U.S. Census data. I will begin by explaining the methods I plan to apply to the COVID-19 dataset.</p>
    <p>This part of the project uses time series forecasting on the COVID-19 dataset from the Johns Hopkins CSSEGISandData Repository and Our World in Data (OWID), with an emphasis on modeling the data using ARIMA/SARIMA and Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS). AR and ARIMA models are univariate (single-variable) time series methods without trend or seasonal components, while other time series models, such as SARIMA, can capture multivariate series with trends and seasonal patterns. Specifically, I will focus on ARIMA since it is effective for univariate modeling, which aligns with the goals of this project.</p>
    <p> First, the data will be loaded into JupyterNotebook and processed with Python. Then, the data is already cleaned through the github repository CSSEGISandData.
    <p>ARIMA is well-suited for forecasting because it applies mathematical techniques to smooth non-stationary time series data, making it easier to predict future values by analyzing historical patterns. These models estimate and extrapolate future states based on trends observed in past and present data. The use of ARIMA for univariate forecasting in this context is ideal for capturing the patterns in the COVID-19 dataset.</p>
    

    <h3>ARIMA Model</h3>
    <p>The ARIMA model is defined by the parameters \( (p, d, q) \), where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>\( p\) is the number of lag observations (autoregressive terms).</li>
      <li>\( d\) is the number of times the data must be differenced to make it stationary.</li>
      <li>\( q\) is the number of lagged forecast errors (moving average terms).</li>
      
  <p>My ARIMA(5,0,5) Model:</p>
<p>For this specific COVID-19 data and the model that I will end up generating, the following is the mathematical expression of my ARIMA model in general terms:</p>
<p>
    \[Y_t = c + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_5 Y_{t-5} + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \epsilon_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_5 \epsilon_{t-5} + \epsilon_t\]
</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\( Y_t \): The value of the time series at time \( t \) (in this case, the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Florida).</li>
    <li>\( c \): Constant term (intercept).</li>
    <li>\( \phi_i \) (\( i = 1, 2, \dots, 5 \)): Coefficients for the Auto-Regressive (AR) terms (from lag 1 to lag 5).</li>
    <li>\( Y_{t-i} \): The value of the time series at previous time steps (\( t-1, t-2, \dots, t-5 \)).</li>
    <li>\( \theta_i \) (\( i = 1, 2, \dots, 5 \)): Coefficients for the Moving Average (MA) terms (past errors).</li>
    <li>\( \epsilon_{t-i} \): Errors at previous time steps (\( t-1, t-2, \dots, t-5 \)).</li>
    <li>\( \epsilon_t \): Error term at time \( t \).</li>
</ul>

</ul><h3>ARIMA Model Application to Python</h3>

<p>The key libraries utilized for processing my ARIMA model were <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, and <strong>Statsmodels</strong>. I used <strong>Pandas</strong> extensively for data manipulation, including loading the dataset, converting date columns to datetime format, applying differencing to achieve stationarity, and other data preparation tasks. <strong>Matplotlib</strong> was instrumental in visualizing the time series, including plotting the original and differenced data, as well as visualizing the autocorrelation and forecast results. <strong>Statsmodels</strong> was used to fit the ARIMA model and provided essential tools for analyzing time series properties, such as plotting the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) and autocorrelation function (ACF), as well as fitting the model itself to make predictions.</p>
      
<h4>Process</h4>
<p>The process of applying my ARIMA model involved several key steps. It is especially important to note that the results were specified down to the Florida, USA level due to the mass size of the data.:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I processed the data from the Johns Hopkins dataset. They had the data already prepared and cleaned, organized by the country, province, state, update, confirmed cases, and more variables. These are the ones I focused on.</li>
  <li>I made sure that the date and time variables were all formatted correctly and cleaned up any NaN values.</li>
  <li>I graphed the general USA COVID-19 graph to see the structure in which the data was moving and determined it was not stationary because it had both a positive trend and it seemed to be affected by some sort of seasonality (this will be explored more in the SARIMA model).</li>
  <li>To determine if the model was stationary or not stationary, I also employed the ADF test, which follows: </li>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>H0:</strong> The data is non-stationary.</li>
    <li><strong>H1:</strong> The data is stationary.</li>
</ul>
  <li> Due to the fact that my p-value was greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and therefore perform a first order differencing on the model. Which is then seen to be stationary under this hypothesis.<li>
  <li>Using the AIC function, I determined the most ideal ARIMA model parameters for (p,d,q).</li>
  <li>I fitted the model and checked the residuals for white noise.</li>
  <li>Developed a forecast for the next 30 days for the state of Florida.</li>
</ol>
      <h2>SARIMA Model with Weekly Seasonality</h2>
    
    <p>After performing the ARIMA model, it can be seen that the data would have been better fitted with a SARIMA model. SARIMA, an extention of ARIMA, also works with linear regression however takes into consideration of the complexity that seasonality can hold within our data. As it can be seen in the EDA, the data has a cylcial pattern. This is common within different epidemiolgy such as flu season, where there are times the data spikes and decreases as medical advances (in our case COVID-19 vaccines or leaving the winter season) can cause diagnosis of COVID-19 to increase or decrease.</p>
    <p>Within the code we explored, the seasonal part of the SARIMA model would look like:</p>
    <pre><code>
    C_t = ϕ_1 C_{t-1} + θ_1 ε_{t-1} + Φ_1 C_{t-7} + Θ_1 ε_{t-7}
    </code></pre>
        <li><b>C_t</b>: The value of the confirmed cases at time <i>t</i>.</li>
        <li><b>ϕ_1</b>: Non-seasonal autoregressive (AR) term, which represents the influence of the immediate past value <code>C_{t-1}</code> on the current value.</li>
        <li><b>θ_1</b>: Non-seasonal moving average (MA) term, which represents the influence of the previous error <code>ε_{t-1}</code> on the current value.</li>
        <li><b>Φ_1</b>: Seasonal autoregressive (SAR) term, which represents the influence of the past value one season ago (in this case, <code>C_{t-7}</code>) on the current value, capturing weekly patterns.</li>
        <li><b>Θ_1</b>: Seasonal moving average (SMA) term, which represents the influence of the error from one season ago (in this case, <code>ε_{t-7}</code>) on the current value, also capturing weekly patterns.</li>
        <li><b>ε_t</b>: Error term at time <i>t</i>.</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>

  <h3>Bayesian Structural Time Series Model (BSTS)</h3>
<p>The BSTS model can be represented as follows:</p>
<p>
\[Y_t = T_t + S_t + X_t \beta + \epsilon_t\]
</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\( Y_t \) is the observed value of the time series at time \( t \) (e.g., COVID-19 confirmed cases in Florida).</li>
  <li>\( T_t \) represents the trend component, which captures the overall movement of the COVID-19 cases over time.</li>
  <li>\( S_t \) is the seasonal component, used to model recurring weekly in my COVID-19 data.</li>
  <li>\( X_t \) represents the regressors, which include external variables such as public policies, mobility, or vaccination rates.</li>
  <li>\( \beta \) is the vector of regression coefficients for the regressors.</li>
  <li>\( \epsilon_t \) is the error term at time \( t \), accounting for random noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the COVID-19 data in Florida, the BSTS model captures the underlying trend, any seasonal effects (such as pandemic waves or reporting delays), and the effect of external factors like public health measures. Bayesian estimation allows for uncertainty quantification, and the components are estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the model.</p>

<h4>Process ( This is GENERAL right now, WILL make more specific as I code) </h4>
<ol>
  <li>Load the dataset and ensure all necessary variables are in the appropriate format for time series analysis (e.g., convert dates to datetime format, handle missing values).</li>
  <li>Define the components of the BSTS model, such as the trend, seasonal, and regression components. Each component captures a specific feature of the time series, like long-term patterns or periodicity.</li>
  <li>Use a Bayesian approach to estimate the model parameters based on the observed data. This involves setting priors and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the model.</li>
  <li>Assess model fit by evaluating posterior distributions of parameters, inspecting residuals, and computing prediction intervals to ensure the model is capturing the underlying patterns of the data.</li>
  <li>Use the fitted BSTS model to generate future forecasts. Predictive intervals are also computed, allowing for uncertainty quantification in the forecasts.</li>
  <li>Perform model diagnostics such as comparing predictions to actual values (cross-validation) or calculating prediction accuracy metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to validate the model's performance.</li>
  <li>Plot the time series, model components, and forecasted values to visually evaluate how well the model explains the data.</li>
</ol>
    
 <h2>Methods for CO2 Emission Forecasting</h2>
 <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>

<p>Upon downloading the file directly from the website, several adjustments were necessary:</p>

<ol>
    <li>The dataset included a descriptive section at the top, detailing information about public use, data stewardship, and other general information. In the CSV file, this was misinterpreted as part of the data, resulting in a lack of proper column headers. This section needed to be deleted to correctly read the dataset.</li>
    <li>The dataset documentation also mentioned that some missing days are asymmetric, which could introduce a high or low bias in the monthly averages. This required attention when handling missing data.</li>
    <li>Due to the eruption of the Mauna Loa volcano, data collection at the Mauna Loa Observatory was suspended from November 29, 2022, and resumed in July 2023. This gap in the data needed to be addressed during analysis.</li>
    <li>The original dataset did not explicitly include "Year" and "Month" columns; however, they were implied by the "decimal.date" field. To facilitate analysis, these headings were added based on the decimal date values.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Methods for CO2 Emission Forecasting</h2>

<h3>ARIMA Method:</h3>

<p>To forecast CO2 emissions, we first download the dataset from the NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory website, where they monitor monthly CO2 emissions at Mauna Loa. After downloading the dataset, I loaded it into a Jupyter Notebook for graphing and exploration.</p>
<p>Initially, the graph of the CO2 data showed both a seasonal pattern and an upward trend, suggesting that the data is non-stationary. To confirm this, I applied the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, which tests the following hypotheses:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>H0:</strong> The data is non-stationary.</li>
    <li><strong>H1:</strong> The data is stationary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a significance level of 0.05, if the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. In this case, the p-value from the ADF test was 1, which is greater than 0.05. This indicates that the data is non-stationary, and stationarization is required.</p>
<p>To address this, I applied the differencing technique. After differencing the data, I re-applied the ADF test, which resulted in a p-value of 0.00005, indicating the data is now stationary.</p>
<p>Next, I examined the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) and Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plots derived from the differenced data. Based on these plots, two potential ARIMA models were identified: (3,1,2) and (3,1,1). I used Python's Statsmodels library to fit these models and selected the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value, which turned out to be the (3,1,2) model. This model was then used to forecast CO2 emissions up to 2025. While the forecast captured the general upward trend, it did not adequately represent the seasonality in the data.</p>

<h3>SARIMA Model:</h3>
<p>To address the seasonality, I applied a Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. Using the same non-seasonal order (3,1,2), I added a seasonal order of (1,1,12) to account for the monthly seasonality. After fitting the SARIMA model and forecasting 60 steps ahead, the resulting forecast captured both the trend and the seasonality of the data, providing a more accurate projection.</p>
